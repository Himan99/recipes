YIELD: 3 cups	UNITS: US
INGREDIENTS Nutrition
2 -3 tablespoons cornstarch
1‚ÅÑ2 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup skim milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
DIRECTIONS
Mix together the sugar and cornstarch, then add the eggs. Beat until the mixture is well combined and pale colored.
In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a boil over miedium-high heat. Stir frequently to keep it from sticking.
Add a little of the hot milk to the egg mixture, and stir until combined. Then pour the egg mixture into the milk.
Cook the mixture until it reaches desired thickness, stirring constantly.
Stir in the vanilla.
Remove from heat, and place plastic wrap on the surface of the pudding instead of just around the pot. This will prevent a skin from forming while it cools.
